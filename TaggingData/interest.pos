MD	will

IN	at 
NNS	brokers 
NNP	James

DT	a

NN	victory 
IN	in

CC	and

NNP	Fellner

DT	An

NNS	Others 
VBP	note

RB	However

NNS	analysts 
VBP	agree 
DT	the

VBZ	is 
RB	largely 
VBG	trying 
TO	to

VBG	holding

DT	The

RB	Some

DT	the 
NNP	Bank 
MD	will 
VB	be 
VBN	influenced

PRP	They 
VBP	argue

VBN	perceived 
IN	as

JJR	safer

JJ	weighted

''	"
CC	But

RB	enough 
TO	to

DT	the

IN	of
NNP	England

PRP	he 
VBD	added

VBD	declined

VBG	resisting

IN	for 
DT	a

NN	move 
IN	before 
DT	the 
NN	budget
,	, 
CC	but 
NN	banking 
NNS	sources
VBD	said 
DT	the 
NNS	authorities 
VBP	see 
DT	the 
JJ	recent 
NN	rise 
IN	in

IN	as 
JJR	more
IN	than 
RB	just 
VBG	marking

NNS	traders

RB	Meanwhile

NNS	analysts 
VBD	noted 
DT	the

VBD	ignored

NNP	Fellner
